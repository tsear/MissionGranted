                MissionGranted is a product of <strong>Smart Grant Solutions</strong>, a consulting firm that has spent years designing grant financial management processes for nonprofits, local governments, and funding agencies.

                After implementing custom workflows for dozens of clients, we recognized a pattern: organizations needed the same core infrastructure—real-time tracking, compliance automation, audit-ready documentation—but configured for their specific funding environments.
            </p>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 md:text-lg dark:text-gray-400">
                So we built it. MissionGranted is the cloud-based platform that powers those workflows, backed by the same expert consulting that designed them.
